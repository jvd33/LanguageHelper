5/5/2015:
Release 1 planned features:
Persistent database that stores all queries/translations so you dont have to query google every time. 
Simple swing GUI (text boxes, option panes to/from language-Croatian only to begin with)
Possible text to speech for help translating? It'll suck, but still a cool feature
English -> Croatian AND Croatian -> English modes (easy)
Use a table structure to store all the translations and their english equivalents

Possible issues:
What do I do about special characters in the language? That's a big problem

TODO:
Seed it with basic translations
Validate user input vs translation in the DB
e.g. ask what pivo means, see if user input is beer
