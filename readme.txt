5/5/2015:
Release 1 planned features:
Persistent database that stores all queries/translations so you dont have to query google every time. 
Simple swing GUI (text boxes, option panes to/from language-Croatian only to begin with)
Possible text to speech for help translating? It'll suck, but still a cool feature
English -> Croatian AND Croatian -> English modes (easy)
Use a table structure to store all the translations and their english equivalents

Database handles croatian chars properly! 

TODO:
Make the GUI less awful (better alternative to swing somewhere, there has to be...)
Different languages, make translation an interface
Fix bug where the language when passed as a param is some bullshit language like portuguese
Show a side panel of the questions you have yet to complete (ex, 1. DONE 2. In progress 3. -- 4. --)
Better scoring system maybe?
